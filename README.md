### This is a repository containing the spreadsheets used for the generation of the figures in the paper, 'Final_paper_name'.

### Requirements: Matlab R2013 or later.

### The repository structure is:

- 'data/figures/' - contains final figures used in the report.
- 'data/processed/' - contains Excel spreadsheet with   processed data (simulation of titration step durations of 3, 5, and ten minutes over 20- and 60-min windows). Selected drugs for simulation were clevidipine, nitroglycerin, norepinephrine, and vasopressin, and a drug X. Included are calculated normalized plasma concentration for 73 kg individual expressed as both percentage and total, calculated instantaneous concentration for 5, 10, 50, 73 and 150 kg individuals, and R (ratio of step duration to half-life) vs. titration step.
- 'scripts/' - all matlab code for project extension work on both single- and two-compartment models, not included in paper.
- 'methods-and-formulas/' - methodology notes for calculations used in master spreadsheet (in data/processed/).
- 'literature/' - preliminary literature review, sources of values for parameters (vd, cl, half-life).
